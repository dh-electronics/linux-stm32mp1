TC358764 MIPI-DSI to DPI panel bridge

Required properties:
  - compatible: "toshiba,tc358762"
  - reg: the virtual channel number of a DSI peripheral
  - vddc-supply: core voltage supply, 1.2V

The device node can contain following 'port' child nodes,
according to the OF graph bindings defined in [1]:
  0: DSI Input, not required, if the bridge is DSI controlled
  1: DPI Output, mandatory

Example:

	bridge@0 {
		reg = <0>;
		compatible = "toshiba,tc358762";
		vddc-supply = <&vcc_1v2_reg>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		port@1 {
			reg = <1>;
			lvds_ep: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&panel_ep>;
			};
		};
	};
